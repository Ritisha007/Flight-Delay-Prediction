# Flight-Delay-Prediction
Predicting flight delay can help passengers and other stakeholders in great a way to better utilize their time or make different plans. Here a Kaggle dataset is used for such flight delay prediction (https://www.kaggle.com/divyansh22/flight-delay-prediction). The data is month of January from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Govt. of the USA. This dataset contains all the flights in the month of January 2019 and January 2020.

The following steps are followed in this project:

-Downloading a real-world dataset from a Kaggle competition.

-Formulate the problem, understand the dataset description, and describe the modeling objective.

-Perform exploratory data analysis, gather insights, perform feature engineering, create a training, validation & test split, and prepare the data for modeling.

-Train & evaluate different machine learning models, tune hyperparameters to improve models.

-Report the final performance of best model(s), show sample predictions, and save model weights.
